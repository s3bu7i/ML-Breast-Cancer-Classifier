**Project Report: ML Breast Cancer Classifier**

**1. Overview**
The project aims to classify breast cancer into malignant (M) or benign (B) categories using various machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, and several algorithms are applied and evaluated to determine the best-performing model. This report outlines the workflow, preprocessing steps, model implementations, evaluation metrics, and results.

**2. Dataset and Preprocessing**
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains 569 entries with 32 features, including ID, diagnosis, and numerical attributes representing tumor measurements.
- **Missing Values**: There were no missing values in the dataset.
- **Scaling**: Features were scaled to ensure models like Logistic Regression and Neural Networks perform optimally.
- **Feature Selection**:
  - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Selected top features based on model performance.
  - **Mutual Information Scores**: Ranked features by their contribution to the target variable.

**3. Model Implementations**
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Hyperparameters: Tuned using grid search, with the best parameters being `{'C': 0.1, 'solver': 'liblinear'}`.
  - Accuracy: Achieved 97% on the test set.
  - ROC AUC: 0.986.
- **Decision Tree**:
  - Hyperparameters: `{'ccp_alpha': 0.01, 'max_depth': 5}`.
  - Accuracy: 95%.
  - Strength: Intuitive and interpretable, useful for smaller datasets.
- **Random Forest**:

  - Accuracy: 98% with SMOTE.
- **Boosting Algorithms**:
  - **XGBoost**:
    - Features: High interpretability using feature importance.
    - Accuracy: 97%.
  - **LightGBM**:
    - Hyperparameters: `{'colsample_bytree': 0.8, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'num_leaves': 20}`.
    - Accuracy: 97%.
- **Neural Networks**:
  - Achieved 98% accuracy with robust performance on unseen data.

**4. Key Insights from Scripts**
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - `RFE&mutual_info.py` identified important features like `perimeter_mean`, `area_mean`, and `concavity_mean`.
- **Balancing Techniques**:
  - `SMOTE&class_weighting.py` improved class balance, especially for minority classes.
- **Pipeline Creation**:
  - `Pipeline_Creation.py` streamlined preprocessing and model training, enhancing reusability.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and classification reports were used to evaluate models.

**5. Model Comparisons**
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Simple yet effective for linear relationships.
  - Best suited for interpretable models.
- **Decision Tree**:
  - Offers clarity in decision-making but prone to overfitting without constraints.
- **Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**:
  - Superior for handling complex patterns and slightly imbalanced data.
  - Achieved high accuracy with optimized hyperparameters.
- **Neural Networks**:
  - Performed well, leveraging complex relationships but requiring careful tuning and scaling.

**7. Recommendations**
- For interpretability, use Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.
- For high accuracy, Random Forest or Neural Networks are recommended.
- Boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM) are excellent for achieving a balance of speed and accuracy.

**8. Conclusion**
This project successfully implemented multiple machine learning models for breast cancer classification. The workflow from data preprocessing to evaluation ensures reproducibility and robustness. Neural Networks and Random Forest emerged as top-performing models, but the choice of model should align with the use case requirements (e.g., interpretability vs. accuracy).
